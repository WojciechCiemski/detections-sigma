# detections-sigma
This repository contains a curated collection of **Sigma detection rules** and supporting resources authored and maintained by [Wojciech Ciemski](https://github.com/wciemski).  
It is designed as both a **learning platform** and a **production-ready base** for detection engineering, blue team operations, and SOC rule development.

Rules are compatible with `sigma-cli` (pySigma) and come with educational materials, lab exercises, and conversion profiles for platforms like Elasticsearch and Wazuh.
